- [What is Proof of Work?](https://alchemy.com/docs/proof-of-work.mdx): Proof of Work is a computationally expensive challenge for computers used to control difficulty and secure a blockchain network through mining, where nodes are financially incentivized to find hashes of data.
- [What are blockchain consensus mechanisms?](https://alchemy.com/docs/what-are-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms.mdx): Blockchain consensus mechanisms are rules that a distributed and decentralized blockchain network follows to agree on what is considered valid.
- [What does a blockchain network look like?](https://alchemy.com/docs/what-are-blockchain-networks.mdx): A blockchain network is a distributed database with nodes worldwide achieving decentralized consensus.
- [What is a 51% attack?](https://alchemy.com/docs/51-percent-attack.mdx): A 51% attack occurs when a miner group controls over 50% of a network, allowing them to double-spend transactions. It's costly and requires more than 51% resources.

- [What is a hashing algorithm?](https://alchemy.com/docs/hashing-algorithm.mdx): A hashing algorithm reduces any input to a unique fixed-sized output. Cryptographic hashing algorithms are one-way, produce the same output for the same input, and have rare collisions.
- [How do tree data structures work?](https://alchemy.com/docs/tree-data-structures.mdx): Tree data structures are hierarchical structures used to store and organize data. They consist of nodes, with a parent-child relationship, and can have different enforcements such as being binary or a binary search tree.
- [What are Merkle trees?](https://alchemy.com/docs/what-are-merkle-trees.mdx): Merkle Trees are a data structure used to efficiently verify that data belongs in a larger set of data. They are commonly used in Peer to Peer networks to increase scalability.
- [How are Merkle trees used in blockchains?](https://alchemy.com/docs/merkle-trees-in-blockchains.mdx): Merkle trees store transaction data efficiently in blockchains. The root hash is committed, reducing blockchain size. Merkle proofs verify data efficiently. They are space and computationally efficient, good for scalability and decentralization.

- [What is Proof of Stake?](https://alchemy.com/docs/what-is-proof-of-stake.mdx): Proof of Stake in Ethereum requires validators to stake 32ETH instead of mining with electricity, resulting in a secure, scalable, and energy-efficient network. Block finality should be considered when requesting data.
- [How does Ethereum gas work?](https://alchemy.com/docs/ethereum-gas.mdx): Ethereum gas is the cost of executing operations. Demand determines the price, with a base fee to incentivize transactions. The fee is burned, and miners receive tips.

Under the hood, Smart Account Client takes care of all the necessary middleware operations needed to populate a user operation such as gas estimation and paymaster data.  If passing in an undefined client, Smart Account Client will treat the connected account as an EOA.  If using with an EOA, Smart Account Client won’t throw an error, but the client itself will stay undefined forever. We recommend useBundlerClient instead when using an EOA. The EOA must also be connected or authenticated with a signer.

- [useBundlerClient](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useBundlerClient.mdx): Custom [hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useBundlerClient.ts) to get a bundler client using the Alchemy account context. It uses `useSyncExternalStore` to watch for any changes in the bundler client configuration and provides the updated bundler client. React hooks don’t handle their own state management directly, so they rely on external stores, like `useSyncExternalStore`, to manage state. `useBundlerClient`’s only job is to call the bundler JSON RPC methods directly; it does not do additional processing, unlike `useSmartAccountClient`. For example, if you call `sendUserOperation`, it expects a fully formed user operation. It is an extension of [Viem’s Public Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public) and provides access to public actions, talking to public RPC APIs like `getBlock`, `eth_call`, etc. It does not require an account as context. Use cases: connecting with a EOA or checking for gas eligibility.
- [useConnect](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useConnect.mdx): Re-exported [wagmi hook](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnect) for connecting an EOA. This hook uses the internal wagmi config though so that the state is in sync with the rest of the Alchemy Account hook state. Useful if you wnat to connect to an EOA.
- [useListAuthMethods](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useListAuthMethods.mdx): A hook to list the authentication methods for a user.
- [useSigner](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useSigner.mdx): [Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSigner.ts) for accessing the current Alchemy signer within a React component. It uses a synchronous external store for updates. This is a good use case if you want to use the signer as an EOA, giving you direct access to it. The signer returned from `useSigner` just does a `personal_sign` or `eth_signTypedData` without any additional logic, but a smart contract account might have additional logic for creating signatures for 1271 validation so `useSignMessage` or `useSignTypeData` instead.
- [useSignerStatus](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useSignerStatus.mdx): [Hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useSignerStatus.ts) to get the signer status, optionally using an override configuration, useful if you’re building your own login.
- [useSolanaSigner](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useSolanaSigner.mdx): This hook is used to create a SolanaSigner instance. It is used to sign transactions and messages for the Solana blockchain.
- [useUser](https://alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react-native/variables/useUser.mdx): A React [hook](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/main/account-kit/react/src/hooks/useUser.ts) that returns the current user information, either from an External Owned Account (EOA) or from the client store. It uses the Alchemy account context and synchronizes with external store updates. The best way to check if user is logged in for both smart account contract users and EOA.  If using smart contract account, returns address of the signer. If only using smart account contracts then you can use [useSignerStatus](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useSignerStatus#usesignerstatus) or [useAccount](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/wallets/reference/account-kit/react/hooks/useAccount#useaccount) to see if the account is defined.
